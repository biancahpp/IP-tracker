# IP Tracker

### Introduction ###

IP Tracker is an application that allows the user to look for an ip address to know its location on a world map. It also gives some other details such as timezone and ISP ( internet service provider).

### How does it work ###

The default location is the user's current IP address. When putting an ip on the input you can see all the details and the location on the map, which can be zoomed in or out.

### Getting Started ###

To get started, simply clone this and create a user on [Geo Ipify](https://geo.ipify.org/) to have an access key.
Change the environment variables using the .env.example as your guide.

On your console:

- Run npm install.
- Run npm start.
